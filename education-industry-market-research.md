Edupunk is a do it yourself (DIY) attitude to teaching and learning practices. Tom Kuntz described edupunk as "an approach to teaching that avoids mainstream tools like PowerPoint and Blackboard, and instead aims to bring the rebellious attitude and DIY ethos of ’70s bands like The Clash to the classroom."[3] Many instructional applications can be described as DIY education or edupunk.

Have we identified a problem a customer wants solved?
• Does our product solve these customer needs?
• If so, do we have a viable and profitable business model?
• Have we learned enough to go out and sell? 

Marketing Requirements Document (MRD) for engineering.
The MRD contains the sum of all the possible customer feature requests, prioritized in a collaborative effort between Marketing, Sales and Engineering. Marketing holds focus groups, analyzes sales data from the field, and looks at customer feature requests and complaints. This information leads to requested features that are added to the product specification, and the engineering team builds these features into the next release.

How do you measure educational quality?
What exactly does it mean for an educational platform to have prestige?


Quality vs. Quantity

Coursera has 33 partner universities and nearly 200 courses, less than 1 year after launching.
edX has 3 partner universities (more coming very soon) and 7 courses. Edit: As of Dec 14, the University of Texas School System, Wellesley College, and Georgetown University have joined, though they don't yet have any courses listed on the site.


====================

Search not for the one-off revenue hits but rather for a pattern that can be replicated by a sales organization selling off a price list or by customers regularly visiting the website.

Scalable
Does the addition of one more salsperson or more marketing dollars bting in more gross profit (or users or clicks) than you invested?
Who influences a sale?
Who recommends a sale?
Who is the decision-maker?
Who is the economic buyer?
Where's the bidger for the purchainng this type of product?
What's the customer acquisition cost?
Has the team learned how to sell a target customer?

Search not for the on=pff revenue hits but rather for a pattern...

Discovering the repeatable, scalable, and ultimately profitable business before running out of cash.

Question your assumptions!



The bridge between university and corporate innovation is still small when compared to the millions of students whose potential we can tap. 


However, early on, we are neither selling or marketing. Before any of the traditional functions of selling and marketing can happen, the company has to prove that a market could exist, verify that someone would pay real dollars for the solutions the company envisions, and then go out and create the market. These testing, learning, and discovery activities are at the heart of what makes a startup unique, and they are what make Customer Development so different from the product development process.

I'm looking to start EdTech in next 2-3 months. The idea is to provide industrial exposure to the engineering students much earlier than they pass out from colleges. During these 2-3 months, I'm looking for the customer development before I kick start my product development process.

I'm looking for help in the following areas:-
1. Connecting to the Vice-Chancellors/Chancellors in different colleges
  - Need contacts, references in engineering colleges
2. Collaboration with Startups, Companies and Industry Experts
  - Need people and companies who are looking forward to lend their expertise to guide the future of India's technical workforce
3. Conducting the surveys targeting the feedback from
  a. Students
  b. Mentors

As a baby step, I've created an online survey mainly focused to collect feedback from students.
Here's the link:
https://mangalbhaskar.typeform.com/to/ywulSa

I will appreciate if you can circulate the survey in your network and any assitance. advice on the above points.

Thank you in advance

Sarvesh Agrawal, Founder & CEO, Internshala

At Internshala, so far, we have figured 3 ways to monetize - 
1. Charge the student - either for core service (i.e. ability to search and apply for internships) or for value added services (say a resume writing service, a skill based training or simply 'promoting' your application up the order in the list etc.). At Internshala core platform is free of cost and we offer 2 value added services (resume writing and online skill based trainings) for which we charge students.

2. Charge the employer - for posting internships (again models may vary in details such as you may charge per posting, per successful hire, per application received etc.) or value added service (such as publicising the internship on social media platforms or in newsletter etc.). At Internshala, so far we have kept it completely free for employers.

3. Charge the 3rd party such as advertisers who may want to advertise their offerings to the student base of the website through banner on the website, through email burst to the users etc.


1. virtual training - online paid training/virtual lab for students.
2. paid career services - resume, cover letter, interview preparation
3. Ads on training pages

Lean thinking de􀀸nes value as providing bene􀀸t to the customer; anything else is waste
what if we simply had o􀀦ered customers anything? For example, what if we simply had o􀀦ered customers the opportunity to download the product from us solely on the basis of its proposed features before building anything?

We could have conducted an experiment, o􀀦ering customers the chance to try something and then measuring their behavior.


To ensure the timely delivery of high-quality products and features.

I discover, create and channelize the customer needs to the required solutions product and feature development

==================


Five questions come to mind for you to consider:
1. You don't have to invest any time in building a product, do you already have at least one paying customer? If no, what's holding you back from testing the value of your business concept right now?
2. How many people does your service involve? (The more people you involve, the harder it will be to iterate and transform your service offering.)
3. Looking down the road a step or two, do you have any interest in scaling the service you provide or will you be satisfied with working you and your current team to capacity and holding steady there? If you want to scale (and there is nothing written that says that you have to), how do you plan to do that?
4. What are the payment terms for your service? In the B2B setting, what is your recourse and plan of action when your customers don't pay you on time?
5. Where are your customers coming from? If you don't have customers yet, where are you expecting them to come from...and why aren't you investing your time there right now?

======================================

Our aim to provide 

online skill development platform
connect industries with the colleges
skill based training & development

industrial exposure to students

Hypothesis

1. The students wants to gain industrial exposure much earlier than they passout from colleges and are willing to pay for such experiences.
2. The working professionals are willing to train and share their knowledge for personal development and for compensation


People will pay for skill & development
Providing hands on experience on the realtime technical problems that industry faces

1. Do consumers recognize that they have the problem you are trying to solve? Yes
2. If there was a solution, would they buy it? Yes
3. Would they buy it from us? If we offer credible and reliable service
4. Can we build a solution for that problem? Yes

“Until we could 􀀱gure out how to sell and make the product, it wasn’t worth spending any engineering time on.”


According to Pew Research, 92 percent of 18- to 34-year-old Americans own smartphones.

1. Make content and ads location-based
You too can take a more localized approach to advertising by using location history to build an audience profile and then targeting ads to those demographics. Use geolocation capabilities, for example, to combine multilingual ads and direct customers to the closest locations. On surveys, 72 percent of participating customers have said they are likely to respond to notifications they receive from a brand when they’re near one of its locations.

2. Recognize the power of mobile to fuel in-store revenue.
To avoid simply measuring app downloads in order to reward high-value app users, offer useful content that actually drives sales. Sephora’s new Pocket Contour app, for example, lets users digitally apply makeup to a selfie and then directs them to the real-life products at the retailer.

3. Use location to adapt to an on-demand economy.
Improve your customers’ lives by using location to deliver convenience. Using location as context, you can determine the simplest, most relevant solution for your customer. For example, consider whether customers need delivery or want in-store pickup or whether your local representatives are in their area.
