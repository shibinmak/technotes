- Licensing & Fees
**What are the licensing options?**
CyberCity 3D currently offers 2 licenses for our 3D Streaming Maps:
1. Basic License
	* This is our most common licensing, and is intended for clients that desire a turnkey solution to visualize and stream their data on Cesium. Let CyberCity 3D take care of the setup, hosting, and streaming of your map. This license includes a setup fee, as well as a standard annual streaming fee.
2. Developer License
	* This is intended for clients who have the desire and ability to download Cesium and create a Streaming 3D Map themselves. This option gives you the freedom to customize your solution as much as you can develop it. There is no setup fee involved-- only an annual streaming fee for access to an API key for high resolution streaming buildings. 
**How does CyberCity 3D produce the high resolution 3D building models?**
	* We create our models using our patent-pending photogrammetric modeling software-- the core of our technology stack. This semi-automatic process begins with the acquisition of stereo-imagery. From there, point clouds are created, which are then formed into our 3D buildings . Finally, the models are exported into one of several leading 3D formats.
**Does CyberCity 3D capture the stereo imagery?**
	* No, we do not capture our source imagery . Depending on the city modeled, we acquire the imagery files from either the local municipality, or third party imagery  endors. The source imagery is captured from either aircraft or satellite. If imagery is not available offthe-shelf, we can contract a new flight over an area from a vendor.

**3D Data**
- 3D Buildings
- Other 3D Objects
	* tree models, billboards, street culture, and proposed property development
- Terrain:  Digital Terrain Model (DTM)
 	* upload your own Digital Terrain Model (DTM)
	* Terrains provide realistic elevation changes on which all other layers will "sit", adding to the real-world accuracy of a map
- Imagery:  base imagery of a map.
	* upload your own high resolution orthophotos for proprietary imagery visualization
- Temporal Data
	* stream various timedependent layers
	* data objects that change over time (such as the position of a satellite)
	* Cesium includes a timeline feature that enables  users to see movement or modifications in information throughout a given period.
-  building a streaming map for clients
