## Game Engines

The most powerful game development platform is now available to everyone. Full engine source code. All features. No royalties. No obligations. No license fee.

Main applications that we have huge competencies with are:- -> Autodesk 3ds Max -> Chaosgroup Vray
-> Pixologic Zbrash -> Marvelous Designer
-> Adobe Photoshop -> Adobe After Effects
-> Autodesk AutoCAD -> Google Sketchup
-> Adobe Illustrator

Stingray
Stingray's big advantage is that it supposedly works within the Autodesk workflow. The less software you have to jump though, the easier it is to make changes. However, it should be noted that even Autodesk screws their own workflows up, FBX linking in Max 2016 and the empty Revit link bug in 2016 I'm looking at you. So while it may work, you can count on Autodesk to figure out how to mess it up. The collaboration tools look pretty slick as well.

The big disadvantage, other than being under the Autodesk development umbrella, is that you have to pay for it. It's not necessarily cheap either, about $240 US per year.

UE4:
Too many advantages to list. Huge advantage goes to their development, their track history, it's 100% free for architecure, and the community resources.

A negative to UE4 is that it can be resource intensive to run and install onto 3rd party systems. You generally need newer hardware to run UE4 apps.

Unity:
Again, quite a few advantages. A huge plus is that Unity will run on anything and has very low system requirements. Of course, the requirements increase as you push the quality, but base Unity scenes will run on even older hardware and mobile devices. Unity also has better (for the moment) web deployment tools. Unity excels in the mobile side due to the mentioned low requirements to run. Their GDC showreel and Adam short film is highly impressive and is starting to give UE4 a run for their money.

A negative is that Unity can be hard to start initially. It is very bare bones and you are left to yourself to write a lot of the initial code. The good news is that on the Unity store there is a ton of pre-made resources and the community is incredibly helpful. For the pro version of Unity, you have to pay for it. The standard edition, however, is totally free. You have to do some research on which one is best for you. Unity does have an AEC side that you can contact, maybe they do deals?

Interior viz, exetrior viz, large scale, small scale, just a movie? a playable game? do you need interactivity? do you know how to code? do you need it photoreal? 100% dynamic lighting or baked? Of course different apps can be better in certain situations but I still think ue4 is one of the most well-rounded engine!


It's always a good idea to stay informed about multiple softwares and technologies :-)

Now, if you want to start learning I think you are better off with Ue4 or Unity because they have the biggest communities and the most learning ressources available right now! No matter what engine you use, in the end your skills will be transferable between each engines. You should download both ue4 and unity, play with them a little bit and see which one feels the best! But trying to learn with Stingray or Cry/Lumberyard will be much harder I think. 

I never checked the Unity asset store but in ue4 marketplace you have a ton of free scenes/games to download and reverse-engineer. I even learned stuff from the unreal tournament editor and it's free maps!!!

And for your furniture, any 3d modeling package will do. Not sure what are the needs right now tho, if there are any hehe! Just make sure you master uvmapping/uv unwrapping because we always want the most realistic stuff even if it's for a game engine!
Good luck!

You'll also need the 'jhead' program installed, for computing focal lengths from Exif metadata. This is available, for instance, as the jhead package on Ubuntu.


```
sudo apt-get install jhead
```

### Image Magic

```
sudo apt-get install imagemagick php-common php-imagick
```
