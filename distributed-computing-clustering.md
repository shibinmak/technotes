Algorithms are among the applications in computer vision which are challenged by the size of the data sets, number of  parameters to estimate and the need for real-time processing:
- Filtering
- Data-transforms
- Image segmentation
- Tracking
- Target recognition

The idea of replacing a single workstation by a cluster of machines, connected through a high-speed network, has been  proven to be an efficient solution for accelerating time consuming batch processing, which could span over several hours, days or even weeks

Many numerical algorithms can be equally implemented using either task or data parallelism

The HPC implementation of data parallelism results in additional communication overhead and requires an interconnect medium with high-bandwidth and low-latency properties.
