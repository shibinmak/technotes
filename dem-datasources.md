# Global DEM Data Sources – Digital Elevation Models


## 1. Space Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM)
- This 1-arc second global digital elevation model has a spatial resolution of about 30 meters covering most of the world with absolute vertical height accuracy of less than 16m.
- Using two radar antennas and a single pass, it collected sufficient data to generate a digital elevation model using a technique known as interferometric synthetic aperture radar (inSAR). C-Band penetrated canopy cover to the ground better but SRTM still struggled in sloping regions with foreshortening, layover and shadow.
- In late 2014, the highest possible resolution SRTM data was released to the public
