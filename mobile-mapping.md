## Mobile Mapping System

Land Mobile Mapping systems acquire data that has application in like safe driving, development of public projects, disaster survey, road survey characteristics. We went through different companies building Land Mobile mapping systems (Rigs) like RIEGEL, Mitushubishi, Trimbel, Topcon, Photoscience, grwinc, imagi, pasco, WSP, iwane. Camera, LiDAR, GPS/IMU are the main sensor components of these systems. They have different configurations and camera's have at least 5MP resolutions. It's only iwane which has vision only based system using couple of FLIR Ladybug cameras. These system have the capabilities to acquire data with the vehicle speed from 20Km/hr to 160Km/hr and process data to provide Absolute accuracy of 10cm and Relative accuracy of 1 cm. Some of the software components of these system includes -viewer, editor, tracer (enable plotting), ortho generator - for image generation from point cloud data.

Some terms we came across during the discussion:-
RTK - algorithm to derive position from the base system
OBD - On Board Diagnostic
CAN  protocol - Controlled Area Network protocol
QPSK - Quadrature Phase Shift Keying
DbW - Drive by Wire




Mobile Mapping System



Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK) is a form of Phase Shift Keying in which two bits are modulated at once, selecting one of four possible carrier phase shifts (0, 90, 180, or 270 degrees). QPSK allows the signal to carry twice as much information as ordinary PSK using the same bandwidth.

ODBI (nervous system); CAN is the protocol - read
