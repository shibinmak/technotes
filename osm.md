Top three editors
ID.svgiD is the easy to use editor found per default on the "Edit" button of the OpenStreetMap homepage, and is ideal for quick editing contributions. It runs in your browser and downloads data automatically as you look around.
Potlatch2logo.pngPotlatch 2 is the precursor to iD, still used by quite a few people, and still available under the 'edit' button drop-down ("â–¼"). Requires Flash.
JOSM Logo 2014.svgJOSM is a highly expandable standalone Java desktop application which allows fluid zooming, panning, and editing of a locally stored dataset, before uploading changes in a batch.
