- https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cassandra/cassandra_introduction.htm

**What is NoSQL database?**
A NoSQL database (sometimes called as Not Only SQL) is a database that provides a mechanism to store and retrieve data other than the tabular relations used in relational databases. These databases are schema-free, support easy replication, have simple API, eventually consistent, and can handle huge amounts of data.

**NoSQL vs. Relational Database**
- NoSql databases use different data structures compared to relational databases.
- The suitability of a given NoSQL database depends on the problem it must solve.

**NoSQL Databases**
- Apache HBase
- Apache Cassandra
- MongoDB

## [Apache Cassandra](http://cassandra.apache.org/)
- Apache Cassandra is a highly scalable, high-performance distributed database designed to handle large amounts of data across many commodity servers, providing high availability with no single point of failure. It is a type of NoSQL database.
- Apache Cassandra is an open source, distributed and decentralized/distributed storage system (database), for managing very large amounts of structured data spread out across the world. It provides highly available service with no single point of failure.
