## Procedural Modeling

Procedural modeling is an umbrella term for a number of techniques in computer graphics to create 3D models and textures from sets of rules. L-Systems, fractals, and generative modeling are procedural modeling techniques since they apply algorithms for producing scenes.

## Generative Modelling
- Generative Modelling Language (GML) in computer graphics and generative computer programming is a very simple programming language for the concise description of complex 3D shapes.
- generative models are models described by mathematical functions and operators arranged in a hierarchy. What distinguishes it is the set of operators that are available.
- To this end, generative modeling offers a mathematically closed set of operators made up of the standard hierarchical operations for rigid objects (push, pop, rotate, translate, name object, etc.), constructive solid geometry operations (intersection, union, subtraction), and operators for creating time-dependent surfaces and other shapes (such as sweep operators, differentiation, integration, inverse functions, constraint solution, constrained minimization).

## Procedural content generation (PCG)
- http://pcg.wikidot.com/
PCG is the programmatic generation of game content using a random or pseudo-random process that results in an unpredictable range of possible game play spaces.
