# IoT - Internet Of Things

##What is the IoT?
- The network-controlled management of certain types of electronic devices â€” for instance, the monitoring of air temperature in a storage facility. Smart contracts make the automation of remote systems management possible. A combination of software, sensors, and the network facilitates an exchange of data between objects and mechanisms. The result increases system efficiency and improves cost monitoring.
