## Smart Cities

## 3D Map Design Principles for Urban City

Classic 2D map design
- parameters and the process itself are well known
- standardized for a long time

3D map design
- process dealing with a creation of 3D maps
- standardization is still ongoing and in development

Aim:
- Outline the already deployed principles in the 3D map’s creation process
- elaborates a workflow of such a process with certain cartographic and other variables.


The 3D Map creation comes from:
* the concept phase
* through modeling stage
* follows by symbolization step
* the final visualization

The process contains:

- data preparation
  - steps from concept to visualization
- definition of cartographic aspects
  - which are divided into the variables together with their definition and design
- derivation of cartographic principles for a design of 3D maps

## Challanges
- technical issues of a visualization of 3D data

a planner can see how a building casts shadows on its surroundings. This can be used to decide where best to plant trees to mitigate heat in the area.


There are challenges that the agency is dealing with in using such a detailed system. Image gathering is one issue. Although advanced techniques like satellite imagery and remote sensing with laser are useful for gathering data on terrain, more intensive modelling techniques have to be used for creating high quality models of the buildings. “For planning we want a very realistic view. For that kind of an experience, we need to do a lot of ground survey and take photographs, so we need to have a team of highly trained people to do that,” Quek said.

While governments have been using digital 2D maps to plan services for  a number of years now, perhaps it is time to consider if an investment in 3D maps could bring higher returns.

The OGC leads the development of geospatial interoperability standards. Esri is a long-standing, active OGC participant, helping GIS users to seamlessly work together.

### Storage of 3D City Models
To store 3D city models, both file-based and database approaches are used. There is no single, unique representation schema due to the heterogeneity and diversity of 3d city model contents. 

Encoding of Components

### Construction of 3D City Models


**Level of Detail**
3D city models are typically constructed at various levels of detail (LOD) to provide notions of multiple resolutions and at different levels of abstraction.

For example, CityGML defines five LODs for building models:

LOD 0: 2.5D footprints
LOD 1: Buildings represented by block models (usually extruded footprints)
LOD 2: Building models with standard roof structures
LOD 3: Detailed (architectural) building models
LOD 4: LOD 3 building models supplemented with interior features.

Level of Detail description
LOD0 is the most basic mode used for landscape applications.

LOD1 is a common massing or block model of buildings with flat roof structures. It shows a 2D outline of the building with min, max or average height above 0 or DTM.

LOD2 is non-textured with differentiated roof structures, pitched roofs, no awnings of furniture. LOD2 is used for city areas and projects.

LOD3 is still non textured architectural models but comprise detailed wall and roof structures, possibly with doors, windows and bridges, etc. Sometimes contains facade detail. 

LOD4 is highly detailed interior structures and exterior for buildings.  LOD4 includes rooms, interior doors, stairs, and furniture.

LOD 1  block model
LOD 2 coarse exterior
LOD 3 fine exterior
LOD 4 interior

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_detail
In computer graphics, accounting for Level of detail[1][2][3] involves decreasing the complexity of a 3D model representation as it moves away from the viewer or according to other metrics such as object importance, viewpoint-relative speed or position.

Level of detail techniques increase the efficiency of rendering by decreasing the workload on graphics pipeline stages, usually vertex transformations. The reduced visual quality of the model is often unnoticed because of the small effect on object appearance when distant or moving fast.

algorithms 
* Continuous LOD (CLOD)
- The given "mesh" function is then continuously evaluated and an optimized version is produced according to a tradeoff between visual quality and performance.
* discrete LOD (DLOD) 
- is to provide various models to represent the same object. 

* Geomipmapping
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geomipmapping
Geomipmapping or geometrical mipmapping is a real-time block-based terrain rendering algorithm

## Level of detail in GIS and 3D city modelling[edit]

LOD is found in GIS and 3D city models as a similar concept. It indicates how thoroughly real-world features have been mapped and how much the model adheres to its real-world counterpart

Besides the geometric complexity
other metrics such as spatio-semantic coherence
resolution of the texture
attributes can be considered in the LOD of a model.


The analogy of "LOD-ing" in GIS is referred as generalization.


•
CityGML LODs are an industry standard for conveying the grade of 3D city models.
•
The 5 LODs are not defined precisely, and they are not sufficient for this purpose.
•
We present a refined series of 16 LODs that overcomes these issues.

Cartographic generalization, or map generalization, is a method for deriving a smaller-scale map from a larger scale map or map data

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_elevation_model
There is no universal usage of the terms digital elevation model (DEM), digital terrain model (DTM) and digital surface model (DSM) in scientific literature. In most cases the term digital surface model represents the earth's surface and includes all objects on it. In contrast to a DSM, the digital terrain model (DTM) represents the bare ground surface without any objects like plants and buildings (see the figure on the right)


DEM is often used as a generic term for DSMs and DTMs,[3] only representing height information without any further definition about the surface.[4] Other definitions equalise the terms DEM and DTM,[5] or define the DEM as a subset of the DTM, which also represents other morphological elements.[ 

DTM as a three-dimensional model (TIN)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangulated_irregular_network
A triangulated irregular network (TIN) is a digital data structure used in a geographic information system (GIS) for the representation of a surface. A TIN is a vector-based representation of the physical land surface or sea bottom, made up of irregularly distributed nodes and lines with three-dimensional coordinates (x, y, and z) that are arranged in a network of nonoverlapping triangles.

A DEM can be represented as a raster (a grid of squares, also known as a heightmap when representing elevation) or as a vector-based triangular irregular network (TIN).

While a DSM may be useful for landscape modeling, city modeling and visualization applications, a DTM is often required for flood or drainage modeling, land-use studies,[10] geological applications, and other applications.[11]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_elevation_model

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_information_modeling

Building information modeling (BIM) is a process involving the generation and management of digital representations of physical and functional characteristics of places. Building information models (BIMs) are files (often but not always in proprietary formats and containing proprietary data) which can be extracted, exchanged or networked to support decision-making regarding a building or other built asset. Current BIM software is used by individuals, businesses and government agencies who plan, design, construct, operate and maintain diverse physical infrastructures, such as water, refuse, electricity, gas, communication utilities, roads, bridges, ports, tunnels, etc.


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadastre

http://www.virtualcitysystems.de/en/products/buildingreconstruction
http://www.virtualcitysystems.de/en/references#projects

One key challenge is to find building parts with their corresponding roof geometry. "Since fully automatic image understanding is very hard to solve, semi-automatic components are usually required to at least support the recognition of very complex buildings by a human operator."

Statistical approaches are common for roof reconstruction based on airborne laser scanning point clouds

Fully automated processes exist to generate LOD1 and LOD2 building models for large regions. For example, the Bavarian Office for Surveying and Spatial Information is responsible for about 8 million building models at LOD1 and LOD2

Visualization of 3D City Models
The visualization of 3D city models represents a core functionality required for interactive applications and systems based on 3D city models.

Examples of specialized real-time 3D rendering include:

Real-time 3D rendering of road networks on high resolution terrain models.[15]
Real-time 3D rendering of water surfaces with cartography-oriented design.[16]
Real-time 3D rendering of day and night sky phenomena.[17]
Real-time 3D rendering of grid-based terrain models.[18]
Real-time 3D rendering using different levels of abstraction, ranging between 2D map views and 3D views.[19]
Real-time 3D rendering of multiperspective views on 3D city models.[20][21

# 3D Maps

“A 3D map is determined as a digital, mathematical defined, three-dimensional virtual representation of the
Earth, surfaces, objects and phenomena in nature and society. Represented objects and phenomena are
classified, designed and visualized according to a particular purpose”, Bandrova (2001);


Looking at the above mentioned definitions, 3D maps are a special type of maps, portraying 3D data. Usual approach
of such a portrayal consists of showing:
A sphere as a reference surface for draping imagery or vector data in small scales;
Terrain (generalized) as a reference surface for draping, while zooming in medium scale;
Detailed terrain, draped 2D geodata, 3D features.
